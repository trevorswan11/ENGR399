### First story
**Context:**
- 1941 - during world war 2 in Morocco
- US not yet in the war
- France has fallen
- One officer, one Nazi, one anti-Nazi resistance member
**Video:**
- Captain Renault said "Round up the usual subjects". What did he mean by that and was this ethical
	- They have people that they aren't well-acquainted with, or are petty criminals, so they can place the blame
	- Captain Renault, the officer, shoots the Nazi member to help the cause to get the resistance member out safely
	- From a consequentialist or virtue ethics point of view, this is considered ethical as the officer is helping the greater cause and fighting Nazism
	- Professionally, this would be unethical according to this example of professional ethics
		***Professional Code of Ethics in Canton, Ohio (Police Force)***
		- All citizens will be treated equally with courtesy, consideration, and dignity

### Professional (workplace) Ethics
- Professionals are expected to adhere to a code of ethics or rules for conduct for their profession
	- Ethical questions are much more black and white, eliminating the questions coming from questions like "should you steal to help your family"

### Second Story
- Football coach at Lacks' high school had a grandson who bought the house that Lacks grew up in
	- Coach was very successful, and leveraged such success to become superintendent
	- The second search result of his name shows a Grade-Fixing Scandal that outset him from his job
**Context:**
- Very racially segregated area
- Racial fights at the HS
- The coach was white and the student athlete with the grade change was black - but Lacks doesn't believe that this was race related as the team was the more diverse and accepting group at the HS
- The coach built the football team so that it would be the most integrated aspect of the school
**Relevance:**
- This is like the "would you steal food to feed your family"
	- Grade changes were minor, one letter grade up for a handful of courses
	- The student ultimately went to university where he graduated with a degree
	- There was no benefit to the coach, he put his reputation and career on the line
- In a professional setting, personal ethics approach is NOT appropriate
	- He was fires, and his reputation tarnished
	- We should not apply a consequentialist perspective
- Moral of the story: You need to follow professional ethics even if your personal ethics might differ
**Engineering Code of Ethics**
- If you're asked to do something that might be wrong...
	- Check your code of ethics
	- Write your concerns in writing - email or actual writing
	- Forward your concerns to the supervisor and HR


> [!quiz] Use either the story of the French police captain or the football coach to explain that in workspace situations, professionals are expected to follow the code of ethics for their profession rather than a personal ethics analysis.
> Q1: The football coach had curated the most integrated group of people in a diverse high school, and was very close to/cared about all of the students on his team. Thus, he boosted some of the grades of one of his students so that he could make it to college and be successful. While a personal review would indicate consequentialism is the way to go here, professionally this was wrong. Violating the professional code of ethics is inappropriate when the reason is purely based on personal ethics. The coach lost his job and thus his great reputation was tarnished. This suggests that we should not violate professional ethics to favor personal ethics.

5. Avoid deceptive acts.
6. Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession.
- Should disclose all conflicts of interest

#### AIChE Code of Ethics
1. Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and protect the environment in performance of their professional duties.
2. Formally advise their employers or clients (and consider further disclosure, if warranted) if they perceive that a consequence of their duties will adversely affect the present or future health or safety of their colleagues or the public.
3. Accept responsibility for their actions, seek and heed critical review of their work and offer objective criticism of the work of others.

9. Continue their professional development throughout their careers, and provide opportunities for the professional development of those under their supervision.
10. Never tolerate harassment.
11. Conduct themselves in a fair, honorable and respectful manner.

#### Thoughts and Discussion
- Paramount means more than anything else, so the first tick on both of these is the strongest rule
- This isn't the case for all professions
	- Lawyers code of ethics
		- Can only disclose information is there is REASONABLY CERTAIN death or substantial bodily harm
		- It is very unethical for a lawyer to share information with the public if the information doesn't put people in immediate harm, even if it violates the paramount rule of engineers

#### Real Estate Development
- A client wants to develop a residential development project in a coastal area with no building code currently
- Engineering study is commissioned and concludes that the project should be built to a 100-year projected storm surge elevation due to public safety risk
- Due to increase cost, the client doesn't want to do this

Ernie, the engineer, should send a letter to the town and report the client's potential future unsafe actions, and should certainly withdraw from the project. Ann, the attorney who privately practices representing the client, doesn't have to do anything. She should recommend to the client that something different should be done. She cannot go public as no building codes or laws are broken. She should defer to the clients decision.


> [!quiz] Boilco, a boiler manufacturer, began to use a more economic suppler of boiler valves. Testing found these could be unsafe. X brought the concerns to senior management, and X's supervisor abruptly fired X for insubordination. After termination, X contacted a deferral agency, detailing the threat to public safety by Boilco.
> Q2: If X was an engineer named Ernie, he is fully in his right to bring the concerns to senior management. While being fired is unfortunate and most likely illegal, Ernie should have left the job anyways if management was hell bent on using the valves that were unsafe. After being fired, bringing the threat to public safety up to a federal agency was necessary and the only good choice, upholding the first point in the Engineers code of ethics holding the safety of the public paramount. If X was a lawyer, sharing this information is unacceptable. While there is a threat to public safety using poor valves, there is not an immediate threat to public safety as a result of the companies actions. Assuming the lawyer is employed by the company, so she (Ann the attorney) has the company as a client and can share concerns with them directly. After being fired however, she cannot share the information about the details. This is because the threat is not immanent, and lawyers can only go public with information if there is REASONABLY CERTAIN death or substantial bodily harm, which is not the case here.

### Lacks ENGR225 Course
- Study Abroad course in may split by a study break
- First year, the mid-course trip included Victoria Falls
- During this trip, something took him by surprise and he was faced with an unexpected dilemma
	- All of the students wanted to go bungee jumping or ziplining
	- Should he have stopped it? Did he even have the authority to stop it?
	- 6-7 months later, there was a story of people bungee jumping off the same bridge and a woman's bungee jumping cord BROKE
		- Now, case has a statement for people abroad saying that people cannot do anything risky
		- This was not the case back then, so should he have allowed the students to jump?
### Conflict of Interest
- When you have two motivations that may be pulling you in different directions
- Examples
	- Assigning a required textbook for which they receive royalties
	- Purchasing materials on behalf of university from a company in which they have a financial interest
	- Accepting gifts from students
- Is a gift appropriate? Is it just a gift or really a bribe
	- Often it is not clear what is a bribe
	- Supreme court ruled that bribery only applies to payments for future official conduct, but remember ethical vs. legal
	- Is the definition of bribe culture dependent 

#### Gifts
- In January, Lacks traveled to Jordan for an accreditation review of a university
- ABET accreditation talks about gifts, for US visits - clear no gifts, for other countries - consult the team chair 
	- It could be ok to accept token gifts related to the university name or culture
- Dilemma
	- Wanted to be dropped off downtown


> [!quiz] As we returned to the hotel after our last day at the university, I wanted to ask the university driver if he could drop me off in downtown (~$10 taxi ride). The driver offered to do it for free.
> Q3: This is only okay if it is approved by the arbiter, who is the team chair. This would be considered a gift by ABET standards. This would be token, as the value is not at the expense of the driver. The university driver is not losing money by doing this, and thus it is likely to be approved. Just to be safe, you should only ask for the ride (without buying a taxi) if your team chair approves it.

- Engineer A is an employee of State DoT. Part of Engine A's responsibilities is to serve as liaison with the consulting engineers and contractors that perform design and construction work for SDoT. Following completion of projects, consulting engineering companies and contractors have sometimes offered the following:
	- Free tickets to the engineering company's box seats at a major league sports event
	- An invitation to golf outing
- From Review board:
	- It is a very common situation that exists in our culture and business community. This is meant to enhance ongoing working relations. IN the context of this case, the board does not believe there was any intent to influence the judgement of Engineer A
- In reality, you should send an email to your supervisor to see if it is ok.


> [!quiz] Rachel runs the Quality and Assurance department at an electronics compnay that manufactures computer servers (used by business to store and manage data). She is responsible for testing these servers, to ensure they satisfy quality control standards, and deciding when new products should be shipped to distributors for sale. This is a very competitive and fast moving market. She will not ship a product that could cause physical harm to the customer, but will ship one that could result in data loss as her company's competitor takes advantage of poor production rate. Is Rachel acting ethically based on (a) consequentialist, deontological or virtue ethics, and (b) the NSPE Code of Ethics? 
> Q4: (a) She is acting unethically when it comes to a personal consequentialist point of view. She should be acting to see the best outcomes of her product, and data loss can be just as detrimental as physical harm, depending on the scenario. According to the company, she is acting according to ethics (positively) as she ultimately gets the best results for the company. (b) According to the engineering code of ethics, she is acting unethically. In an attempt to better her company and act faithfully to her employer, she is acting deceptively and putting the welfare of the public at risk. As the loss of data is horrible for customers in this day and age, she is not holding the rights of people paramount, and is deliberately acting deceptively to benefit her company over the company.


> [!quiz] You are a lead engineer for a company that designs military drones for India. You went to the factory and saw indications that the company may be using forced labor. The company's manager does not answer your concern in a straightforward way. (1) Consider all the factors at play here. What are the most salient ethical issues to consider? What else might influence your decision about how to act? Take into account the perspectives from various stakeholders. (2) Which of the NSPE principles are most relevant to the situation and why?
> Q5: (1) The most pressing ethical issue is that the company is being secretive about their work force and is using forced labor outside of the public scope. You should act in such a way that calls out the company. This means that you should report the practices of the company to your supervisor and should argue your contractors and stakeholders from moving out of this company as an investment. Though prices may increase with more expensive, non-forced labor, it is worth it for benefiting public safety and thus you should call out and try to break from QEM. (2) This violates the "Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public" the most. This is because people are being forced to work and are most likely being mistreated and underpaid, so thus the public are being placed in harms way due to the companies malpractice.
