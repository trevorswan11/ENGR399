### Company Recruits nurses from lower income countries to work in US hospitals
- Company is taking the ethical issue seriously
- Ethics: How does this affect their home country's nurse supply (consequentialist), effectively forcing someone into the position "how could they say know", they are people with rights which should be respected(deontological)
- No easy answer because you don't want to hurt these countries but you want to give people a good position
##### This company also made a product to monitor vital signs and send the data to a cloud to have professionals monitor that data
- They are developing a pulse oximetry device - known to not work as well for those with dark skin, reporting that they are healthy when they really are not


> [!abstract] Underlying Engineering Topic
> If you have a flowrate into a tank and a flowrate out of the same tank, what is the differential equation you can use to describe the change in Volume over time?
> $$\frac{dV}{dt} = F_{in} - F_{out}$$

### The Aral Sea
- Aral sea not shown on one map, but shown clearly on another. Why?
	- Russian empire conquered and colonized central Asia around the 1800s (lasted until 1917)
		- Overthrown in 1917, where the USSR was then formed in 1922
		- The USSR was dominated by Russia, but included 14 other republics in central Asia


> [!info] What caused the Aral Sea to dry up?
> They (the USSR) took what was desert and turned it into very productive cotton farms. They used the water from the rivers to irrigate cotton fields. Doing an engineering analysis on the Flow rates in and out of the rivers. 
> - Before the production started, only flow rate out was through evaporation, so $\frac{dV}{dt}$ is balanced and remains at 0
> - After the start of the cotton irrigation, $F_{in}$ is much less that $F_{out}$, and thus the sea dried up

- The Aral Sea was a massive body of water in 1960, but is now just a desert with sea shells and ships
	- Also dust devils there too with desert vegetation
	- Lacks visited there for a conference on Atmospheric dust
	- Part of the conference focused on the desertification of the Aral Sea


> [!quiz] Q1: Do you think technologies that redistribute resources "have politics"? Explain your answer in the context of the Aral Situation.
> Q1: Yes, the politics specifically pertain to gain power or resources at the expense of others. In terms of the Aral situation, the river diversion resulting in drying up the rivers, which benefited the USSR as a whole, but hurt the people in the Aral region. While it could be argued that these technologies would be completely under the control of the governing bodies, but these canals/diversions were inherently political. They took advantage of a large source of water, specifically feeds to the Aral sea, with no respect to the land they were taking from. This resulted in people growing up there, like the lady from the video, having an almost deserted homeland. Ultimately, I think that these redistributing technologies have politics as they inherently must take from one group to benefit another.

### What about in the US?
- Looking at a map of the western side of the united states, you can see two lakes going away in California (Owens lake, for example) and one lake being created in the bottom right of the state
- Los Angeles was built in an area that really didn't have water, so they had to bring water in from other places - Owen's lake had an aqueduct created to transfer water efficiently
	- Wasn't good for the people that lived in Owen's valley, who had to force migrate as they had no water to use for themselves
	- People abandoned their farms, ranchers attacked the aqueduct 
	- Now is like the Aral sea, and LA had to pay lots of money (2.5 billion) to solve dust problems


> [!quiz] Is it useful to distinguish "intentional" and "unintentional" harms from technology? Explain your answer using the LA aqueducts as the context.
> Q2: No, I do not think distinguishing this is useful. The distinguishment only serves to make the offending party feel better about their choice. This does not feel any better for the hurt group of people. From the location of LA, not having a lot of water, it was less of intentional vs. unintentional, and more of this is the only thing that could be done. As much as it could be argued that this was intentional as they chose where to get the water, it can also be argued to be unintentional as they just happened to need water based on the location and Owen's lake was the most convenient. Either way, the Owen's value community was clearly damaged by the lake being used for water, so the classification does not matter here. I would generalize this to say that we should not classify technology like this and instead should focus on the affected communities and how to avoid these issues in the future or remedy past mistakes before they spiral out of control.

#### Could this happen today?
- Utah lawmakers want to do something similar
- In Ohio, people are concerned about Great Lakes Water
	- Plan from a business man in Toronto to sell ship water and tankers from Lake Superior to somewhere in Asia, he got a permit to do that
		- 420,000 gallons/day to sell to Asia for people who needed drinking water
		- People in the US were concerned about the same thing happening with the Aral Sea and Owen's lake
	- The Great Lakes Compact was created to ban the diversion of water out of the Great Lakes Basin, with limited exceptions
		- President Bush signed off on it, Can not send it out across/out of the bordering land
- Chicago wants to make a billion dollar deal to show great lakes wealth. How come they can sell the water?
	- Chicago river is at the heart of the dispute
		- Engineers reversed the Chicago River in 1900
		- Before 1900
			- It flowed into Lake Michigan
			- Sewerage from Chicago carried into Lake Michigan
			- But Chicago gets their water from that same lake!
		- After 1900
			- Canal from Chicago River to lower elevation point
			- Sewerage flows into the Mississippi River instead
	- Legal Battles, Wisconsin v Illinois resulting in Illinois needing to reduce to 1 billion gallons/day
	- This is why they can sell this water
		- If they aren't using the full amount, they can sell!
- New York Times article says that we might have to pipe the great lakes to California


> [!quiz] Regulations restrict what can be done with Great Lakes water. What is one argument discussed that supports this restriction, and what is one argument discussed that supports relaxing the restriction? Do you think the restriction should be relaxed?
> Q3: For support of this restriction, we argued that if we were to divert much of the water in the great lakes on a daily basis, then the lakes would eventually dry out and then there would be a similar situation to what happened with Owen's lake and the Aral Sea. This would result in less water in the great lakes, which holds a fifth of the planets fresh water supply. In terms of relaxing the restriction, we argued that it might eb necessary to send water to California, as many states, including those around the great lakes, get their crops from California. If they run out of water, which they currently are, then the farmers cannot continue to produce crops for the nation, and hence communities would suffer. Sending water would remedy this, but requires relaxation of the restriction. I would argue that we should lift the restriction, but only by a little. There should be very strict regulations on sending water, and it should be metered and reassessed when necessary. This would keep water manageable while still allowing crops to be produced.

#### The Salton Sea
- A new lake in the bottom right corner of California
- The Imperial Valley is very green inside, but is surrounded by desert
	- Need irrigation to grow things in the Imperial Valley
	- Huge network of irrigation valves throughout the valley
	- Where does this irrigation come from?
		- The Colorado river!
		- The Alamo Canal as the original canal to bring water from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley
		- Chaffey Gate was created to control flow into the canal
	- But something went wrong!
		- Colorado River originates in Colorado and Wyoming
		- Winter freezes reduce flow in Colorado River
		- The inlet to the Alamo Canal was not at river bottom but higher - not as much waster in the winter even though the winter is great for crops in Imperial Valley
	- A solution
		- A deep bypass was built to get water in the winter
		- Bypass was not controlled, so there was another error! This diversion made the Salton Sea as the Entire Stream of the Colorado river was sent to the Alamo Canal for an entire two years. This created the sea!
	- There is no flow into the Salton sea, just water from farm runoff
	- Now there are health issues associated with people (children specifically) living next to the dying lake due to dust
	- People now describe it as a (Post) Apocalyptic region


> [!quiz] What is the "imperious immediacy of interest", and explain how it may have played a role in the formation of the Salton Sea?
> Q4: We can look at the "imperious immediacy of interest" as someone wanting the intended consequence of an action so much that they purposefully choose to ignore any unintended effects. This can be applied to our discussion here as we could say the engineers who originally decided to make this choice for water were so driven to get water to the area to produce crops during the winter, that they were ignorant to the issues of running an uncontrolled river to the land. Ignoring this consequence, water was effectively transferred to the region, but an error occurred due to the rashness of the design choice. This resulted in the sea being created. The engineers most likely purposefully ignored the chance of an error happening just to see their desired end goal.
