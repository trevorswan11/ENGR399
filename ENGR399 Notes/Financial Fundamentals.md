### Saving for Retirement
##### Volunteers
##### Volunteer 1
- Today, decides to start saving $200 a month towards retirement
- Invests in a mutual fund and earns the annual average of 8.5%/yr
- 10 years from now, stops saving
##### Volunteer 2
- Today, buy a car
- Finances it at $200 per months for the next 10 years
- 10 years from now, begins savings $200 / mo towards retirement. Also earns 8.5% on investment
- Continues this investment for the next 30 years until retirement

###### Who invested more income?
- Volunteer 1: $24,000
- Volunteer 2: $72,000
###### Who has more money in 40 years?
- Compound Interest
$$
A=P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}
$$
where A is the final amount, P is the initial principal balance, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is applied per time period, t is the number of time periods elapsed
- With compound interest
	-  Volunteer 1: ~$411,000
	- Volunteer 2: ~$300,000
- Every single year you wait to start investing, it has a severe negative impact on your future savings!


> [!quiz] Compound interest! Go to this [link](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator). A) $0 principle, $100/mo @ 5% interest over 40 years, B) Same but over 35 years, C) Why is there such a discrepancy?
> Q1: A) $144,959.73 B) $108,384.37, C) you end up with much less money because compound interest is exponential. The longer you have money in your account, the more it gains interest. This interest makes interest and that interest makes interest each period. by reducing the number of years spend compounding, the compound interest formula's exponential term gets lower and lower, severely impacting the amount of money you end up with. Graphically, exponential growth is severely impacted by shorter intervals.

##### Typical Retirement Goals
- Retire at 65
- Keep the same lifestyle - need 70-80% of pre-retirement gross income
- Do not want to worry about having enough money/living too long
- Retirement income sources
	- Social security - out of your control, only replaces a small portion of typical income
	- Pensions - not very common anymore
	- Employer sponsored savings program - to be discussed...
	- IRAs - to be discussed...

##### How much to save per year?
- Pay yourself first
- The rule of thumb is to save 13-17% of your income for retirement. This is supposed to get your 80% goal at 65
- Suggested to get closer to 17%+ especially before you have to take on more financial responsibilities

###### How to save 15%
- Most employers help you! However, they often require that you at least match them
- Lets take a sample company which gives you 5% and matches up to 5%
	- If you contribute nothing, you save 5% per year and are wasting free money
	- If you contribute 5%, you save 15% (the minimum you should do)
	- If you contribute 10%, you save 20% (this is on the higher end)
- You are literally giving away free money if you don't fully match your employer
- There is an IRS cap on your portion of the contribution ($23,500 in 2025), but this does not include your employer - a really important benefit

###### IRAs - Types
1. Pay Tax Later
	- Traditional - most employer plans
	- Pay no taxes now, pay when the money is dispersed
	- Interest grows on the money you would have paid for taxes
	- Probably better to focus on when young
2. Pay Tax Now
	- Roth IRA
	- Pay taxes now, no taxes later
	- Helpful to balance portfolio
	- Probably can worry about this a little down the line
###### Retirement Saving - Opinion
- Set your goal at 20% (combined with employer portion) and see what happens
	- If this is too much, settle somewhere closer to 15%
	- Down the road, either educate yourself or pay an expert
	- Don't check the balance too often
		- You will just stress yourself out
		- Check maybe once a year - maybe more frequently as you approach retirement age
	- Balanced Target Date Mutual Funds
		- Available through most providers
		- Usually called something like "Target 2065"
		- All in one plans (rebalancing, management, etc)
		- Low cost, good performance, hand off
		- Great starting point


> [!quiz] The CWRU Plan C retirement benefit includes: direct 6% contribution of your pay; 50% match of your retirement contribution, up to 4% of your pay. A) How much do you need to contribute to your retirement account in order for your account to grow by 20% of your pay? B) How much "free money" are you losing if you do not contribute to your retirement account?
> Q2: A) You need to contribute 10% of your pay to retirement, as CWRU will cover 6% directly, and then min(0.50 x 10, 4) = 4%. So CWRU contributes the remaining 10% to get the 20% goal. B) You are losing 14%, as the university will directly contribute 6%, but if you do not contribute then they will not match anything as there is nothing to match. You lose the 50% match, and then the 10% you were originally putting in.
### Emergency Funds
- A stash of money set aside to cover the financial surprises life throws your ways
- Unexpected, stressful, and costly
- Top issues:
	- Job loss
	- Medical or dental emergency
	- Unexpected home repairs
	- Car troubles
	- Unplanned travel expenses
- You should have at least 3 to 6 months of expenses in your fund
- Keep it in a place like a money market fund - it is safe and accessible
- Build it up gradually, but have a plan to save up. A good goal might be to build it up over 5 years
- Will constantly need "topping off" as you make more money (and have more expenses) over your life
### Buying/Leasing a Car
- Get pre-approved for a loan
- Keep it simple at the dealership
	- Don't argue interest rates, argue about the actual cost
- Negotiate the car first, then the trade in
- Just say no to extras
	- Average of a 300% markup on everything they try to sell you afterwards
- Don't get underwater
	- This means you owe more than what the car was worth - this is not good!
- Consider buying used
	- This will be much more financial than a lease, but maintenance costs should be considered
- Plan to go test drive, don't buy the car the first time you go look at it
- Depreciation is not linear
	- Most cars are around 50% of their original value after 3 to 4 years
#### Buying vs. Leasing a Car
- Trade offs to both
- Depends on how you use it: how long will you keep it? how long will you drive it?
- Pay it off faster than it deprecates
- Calculate the total out of pocket (financing included) for each option over a 3-year period and make a decision
	- There are a lot of online tools that can help with the decision
	- Your best friend is knowledge, and the dealers best friend is confusion


> [!quiz] What does it mean to be underwater with your car?
> Q3: If you are underwater with your car, then that means you owe more than the car was worth. This can happen if you total your car after 3 years, and you had taken a loan out. The insurance company will pay you for the value of the car, but you will still have to pay the insurance company and the loan off, so then you ultimately owe more than what you originally owed for the car.

### Debt
- Make and maintain a current inventory of your debt
	- Student loans do not get wiped out with bankruptcy
- Pay off the debt with the highest after-tax cost
- If you have a tie between two loans
	- Pay what cannot be written-off in bankruptcy first


> [!quiz] What type of debt should you always try to pay off first, and why?
> Q4: You should pay off debt with the highest after-tax interest rate first. This is self-explanatory, you want to minimize the amount of money you have to pay in the long run, where highest interest rates will grow the fastest in value. If you end up having two loans/debt tied with interest rate, you should pay off the one that cannot be written off in bankruptcy, this is because you may need to file for bankruptcy, and don't want to be weighted down by debt that you could've paid earlier.

### Summary - First Year

- Make a plan for your emergency fund and start saving 5% a year
- Get insurance policies for at least a car, home, liability, and healthcare
- Stat with your employer plans for life insurance and disability
