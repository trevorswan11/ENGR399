##### Hazards
- A chemical or physical condition that poses risk
- What is a hazard? Is O2 a hazard? etc.
- Water
	- Hazard for those drowning
- Oxygen
	- Combustion, Troy Michigan child dies in explosion
- Carbon Dioxide
	- Suffocation causes it to be a hazard

### Cleveland explosion of FlowPolymers plant
- Man was working and explosion left him with 3rd degree burns over 75% of his body
- Context:
	- Company produces asphalt pellets sold to tire companies used as homogenizing agents to help mix different types of polymers
	- Asphalt dust is created during the manufacturing of pellets, where a worker sweeps up the dust and puts it in a "super sack"
	- When the suck sack is filled, it is brought to a heated railcar to be melted
- Lacks was an expert witness
	- Was the material being transferred a flammable and or explosive hazardous substance
	- did ordinary operating conditions lead to electrostatic discharges that ignited the material
	- were the supervisors in charge of the activities aware of these dangers prior to this incident
	- did the supervisors deliberately misrepresent the risk
- Can materials like the powder and non dairy creamer be explosive
	- They are all made of carbon
			- They are thus combustible due to a simple combustion reaction
			- CnH2n + 1.5O2 react
	- In the form of tiny dust particles dispersed in air, lots of material is in contact with O2
- **Identify Hazard:** Dust particles and oxygen
	- Non dairy creamer - for example (not directly related)
		- Sugar dust basically - cannon used to make a large flame/explosion
- **Initiating event:** Triboelectricity
	- Two surfaces with different electric potential, if the voltage difference is high enough you get a spark
- In this accident, there is a metal funnel used to direct the material down, and the powder flows into the funnel and rubs against the funnel, charging the funnel to a high voltage
	- The railcar (at a low voltage) and the funnel are not electrically connected, large voltage difference 
	- Voltage difference resulted in a spark and the dust cloud ignited
- **The result:** Third degree burns on 75% of the victims body
- Did the supervisors deliberately misrepresent the risk? How can we decide this?
	1. Challenges to be being an expert witness?
		- Paid for testimony, the more you help the case, the longer you stay on the job
		- You may come to truly believe that the side employing you deserves justice
		- Certain pull to a 'team'
		- Must represent with a high degree of scientific certainty, but there's no empirical claim that can ever be known with 100% certainty
- Do you have a moral obligation to be clear about uncertainty as an expert witness? What if the lawyer who hired you tells you string and confident answers are needed for their client to receive justice?
	- A key claim made by the plaintiff's lawyers was the company supervisors deliberately misrepresented the hazards of the dust, but what does this mean
	- How might your interpretation of this question change based on your relationship to the case (i.e., being the expert witness for the defendant vs. one for the plaintiff)
		- Maybe its not your place as an expert witness to be consequentialist, but you should instead be virtuous and speak truthfully regardless of the stance of your 'team'.
- Controls to enhance safety
	- Preventative Controls - before the incident
	- Mitigative Controls - After the incident
	- Engineering vs administrative controls
		- Engineering controls are passive and are always on, like fences, railings, and splash guards
		- Administrative controls are active controls that only function when specified
- **Safety Control:** Electrically bonding of funnel to railcar
	- Preventive, and active control. Not automatically on as the funnel is not always attached, and preventative because it acts to reduce risk of incident before it happens


> [!quiz] Do you think that the role of the expert witness should be to provide knowledge objectively in support of their side's client on their quest for justice? Include in your answer either the issue of certainty or the issue of interpretation of a concept.
> Q1: I believe that, as an expert witness, you should be presenting fully truthfully, but you should also leave out parts/details that might hurt your case. Assuming that the opposing side has an expert witness of their own, it is not in your best interest to share every possible thing that you know about the case. The truth of the matter should be explained and shared objectively to a degree of certainty, as nothing scientific is really 100% certain. Only once the details you're sharing surpass some arbitrary cutoff for certainty for helping your case is when you should objectively share details of the truth. If you overshare uncertain information, then it can be used against you. To that end, you should not make seemingly objective statements for subjective ideas, as you will result in swaying the beliefs of others as you have more pull as an expert witness. Ultimately, I believe that you should only share information that you believe to be objective to a self-determined degree of certainty, which also benefits your 'teams' side of the argument.

### OSHA Story
- Large Georgian wine vat in Qvevri, people need to go in and clean the inside between batches
	- CO2 builds up in the vat, so if someone goes in there might not be enough O2 in there
	- Solution?
		- The person working would sing and that singing was a sign of life, so if the singing stops then it means the worker is unconscious

> [!quiz] For the cleaning process, what is the hazard, what is the initiating event, what is the safety control and is it preventative or mitigative.
> Q2: The hazard is the heavier CO2 gas lingering in the vat as a result of the fermentation process. The initiating event is going into the confined space and starting to breathe in the CO2 gas. The safety control is having the person inside the vat sing, and having someone outside listening. This person outside and the signing are a mitigative safety control, where they listen out for the person to stop singing which indicates they have fallen unconscious and need to be returned to O2.

### Bhopal India Industrial Disaster
- About 5 thousand or more died within 48 hours, and even more tens of thousands in the coming days
- The plant was operated by Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL)
	- split roughly (50.9 to 49.1) USA to India ownership
- Accident involved a precursor to Sevil, using Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)
	- Fatal if inhaled, serious eye damage
	- Denser than water
	- Boils at low temps (about 100F)
	- Twice as heavy as air - wont float away
	- Fire hazard - reacts violently with water
	- Very exothermic
- Safety Systems for MIC
	- Storage tanks kept at 0C to keep from boiling
	- Alarm sounds above a set temperature
	- Can take the material through a pressure release value to convert MIC to safe product
	- Another pressure release valve to burn MIC into a safe product
	- These are ACTIVE controls
- Incident report
	- One to two thousand pounds of water entered the tank (claimed sabotage but no evidence) - causes heating up
	- Refrigeration system turned off in June, and the disaster happened in December
	- Without the fridge on, the alarm wasn't working as the gas was at an ambient temperature above the threshold that they didn't reset for the higher ambient temp
	- Both the scrubber and flare were turned off, so there was no way to stop the gas from releasing into the air
- No criminal charges against USA people, but people in India were convicted 26 years later

> [!quiz] What is "normalization of deviance" and why is it relevant to the Bhopal Disaster?
> Q3: Normalization of deviance is where you accept things that aren't working properly as the correct way to live/operate. For this disaster, all of the control systems in place were either out of service or disabled for months prior, and it was simply accepted that this is the way things should be in the plant. This deviance took the form of having no way to prevent disaster, and it grew into alarm systems not being calibrated, and having the fridge off for 6 months prior. This deviance was normalized to the point where those working didn't think anything was wrong with what they were doing. 


> [!quiz] Title
> Q4: Yes, I think that the engineers working on the plant from the USA should carry some ethical responsibility and should be charged as such. They asserted that the Bhopal plant had almost no contact with the US. They admitted 40 people had been from the USA on the plant, out of 1000 Indian workers. These facts were asserted by the Union Carbide, so the factuality and bias should be carefully criticized. Union Carbine owned over half of the company, and thus should be more engaged with the workings of the plant, even if its in Bhopal. UCIL, having most of the people on the plant, definitely bears most of the ethical burden, but the USA engineers trained on the plant should've been more skeptical and should have reported issues to the USA workers at home. Little to no communication between UCIL and Union Carbide does not excuse the disaster or save the US engineers accountability.
