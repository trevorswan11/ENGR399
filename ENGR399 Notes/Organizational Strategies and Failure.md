## Challenger Explosion

> [!abstract] Standard Story
> Heroic engineers knew there was a problem and tried to stop the launch, but unscrupulous managers were more concerned about budgets and ignored the warning of the engineers

- The real story is not so simple, it says the problem is all from the Moral branch (from lecture 2)
- Managers were not ignorant and amoral, and were actually moral and rule abiding , calculating risk
- What is an acceptable risk?
#### Context
- The issue for the decision makers at all levels was not weather NASA flying with known risks, but how large those risks were
- With no design precedent and no ability to test the vehicle under full environmental forces, data from in-flight performance was paramount
- Managers and engineers was not a clear distinction, everyone there was an engineer

#### How this happened
- Solid rocket boosters are huge, and need to be assembled and shipped in parts
- Flames leaked out of a joint between solid rocket segments
	- The leak gets bigger and bigger
	- Created thrust in wrong directions, caused solid rocket booster to come loose of the fuel tank
- Connecting the exterior and the interior parts involves two O-rings and some putty
	- High pressure loosens the seal of the o rings
- The solid rocket boosters are reusable. After a flight, they are disassembled and refueled
	- Second Flight - They found erosion on the O-rings, which was a large problem but they deemed it acceptable
	- Eleventh Flight - Even more damage to O-rings, but they believe that, through modeling, it will be ok
	- Third launch had most ever erosion, where there was erosion on the second O-ring
- By the end of 1984, erosion was accepted and expected
- On the day of the tragedy, its very cold (bad for rubber)
	- NASA managers brought up issues independent of temperature, so they never had an urgency to describe the temperature effect
- Day before the launch, lots of people met and decided that the O-ring temp must be greater than or equal to 53F
- Normalization of Deviance
	- The work group normalized the deviant performance of the SRB joint
	- Normalized meaning that behavior the work group first identified as within the norm for acceptable joint performance, then finally officially labeled as acceptable risk
	- Redefined evidence that deviated from an acceptable standard so it became the standard
	- This is the key reason for the Challenger disaster identified by Diane Vaughan in her book
	- Example: Going out in public during covid without a mask just once

> [!quiz] Normalization of Deviance: What is the normalization of deviance, and what is one example of deviance that you have personally encountered?
> Q1: The normalization of deviance means taking actions that were typically established as societally deviant or unacceptable, and doing them so regularly that they become the norm and are widely accepted by a group or population. In my life, one example of this I've encountered is when students, faculty, and professionals use AI to help complete tasks. At the start of its use, it was widely shunned as a tool due to its lack or originality and predictive nature, but now it is widely accepted and thought of as a useful time saving tool for most tasks, assuming it is used correctly. This normalization occurred quickly, and is incredibly fascinating to me how widely accepted and easily accessible AI is today.

## Chernobyl
- Located in Ukraine, was at the time part of the USSR (western side)
##### What does a nuclear reactor do?
- Water is boiled by reaction
- Steam from water goes through turbine which generates energy
- Steam exiting turbine gets cooled and condensed to feed back to the reactor
- Involves two components, heating and cooling
- Uses nuclear fission 
	- Fission events cause the reaction, but can be too fast to react well
	- Chernobyl used Graphite to slow their reactions, which is not as safe as US reactors using water
##### Role of water
- In the US, water cools the reactor and slow down neutrons
- In the USSR, water cools the reactor and has no impact on the reaction
- If water flow to reactor stops:
	- USSR reactors will continue to be heated up
	- US reactors will stop as the water is needed to slow down the neutrons
	- Reactor temp increases in both due to heat transfer
	- Inherently safe design in US reactors as if a problem occurs, the reaction stops inherently
##### On-Off and Volume Control Rod
- Control rods are made of a material that absorbs neutrons
	- Control rods fully out - no control of chain reaction
	- Control rods fully in - reaction cannot proceed
	- Volume control rod - Intermediate positions to tune rate
##### Meltdown - April 1986
- Chernobyl reactor 4 had a schedule shutdown for routine maintenance
- A test to improve safety was planned in conjunction with the scheduled shutdown
- Needed 700-1000 MW for the test, but the power dropped too much (30 MW)
	- Pulled out most of the control rods
- Due to control rods, power jumped up to 200 MW
	- Too low, so they pulled more
- Power got to high after they start test but could not fix it because the control rods were too high and it took too long to lower the rods
- Unapproved changes in the testing procedure resulted in catastrophe
	- Personnel were unaware of certain risks, and it was cooked because of that
##### Management of Chain Review
The idea is that, with any small change, you must bring in a group of people of different backgrounds to analyze the risks of making even the slightest of changes.

> [!quiz] How is inherently safe design relevant to Chernobyl? How is management of chain review relevant to Chernobyl. 
> Q2: Inherently Safe Design is relevant because it was not part of the reactor in Chernobyl. In the context of US nuclear reactors, they are built with inherently safe design as they use water to both keep the reaction moving and also cool/slow the reaction. So that means if the water supply is cut, then there is no way for the reaction to proceed and the process shuts down. This is inherent safety. The Chernobyl reactor didn't have this, using two different materials for the reactor. They used graphite to slow then reactor and water cools it. Water here does not slow the reactor, so an issue with water supply results in an uncontrollable reaction. For management of chain review, the engineers working on the test of the reactor on that night didn't know the consequences of the test they were doing. With management of chain review, they would've had to get their test and its changes cleared with a board of people with different backgrounds. They did not have this and, since they didn't understand the risks, resulted in a disaster.

##### Firefighters
- They rushed in to prevent the disaster, but many died in the next month due to radiation poisoning
- If you were in charge of the situation, would you send in firefighters knowing they would die, but also knowing that if they do not go in this nuclear disaster could claim MANY more lives? Do you follow a consequentialist, Deontological, or Virtue Ethics approach?
	- I take a consequentialist point of view. The firefighters will ultimately save more lives if they go in, even if it costs them their lives. This is similar to the Trolley problem, but easier to answer for me. As discussed in class, firefighters are public servants, and follow a social contract, and have jobs that inherently put their lives at risk. Even though the firefighters will experience a miserable death, I believe that it is still worth saving the lives of a greater innocent public than to prevent the death of a group of people who know their job puts their lives on the line.
