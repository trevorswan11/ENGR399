### Whiskey and Water
- Why does it taste better with water
	- Lacks cited in a news article about this
		- If it really does make the whiskey taste better, why not just bottle it that way? It will deteriorate the flavor!
	- 3M Accuses Purell Maker of Patent Infringement
		- Lacks worked with GOJO as a consultant to try and get around this
			- Hand sanitizer is mostly ethanol and water, like whiskey -- both use a surfactant to bring out desired properties (i.e. foam in sanitizer, taste in whiskey)
	- Workout influencer dances in front of Myanmar coup
		- Protests, unlike hers, from protests
		- April is her name, she is a coauthor on the paper discussed
	- The other coauthor (Dan) is now a patent agent and is completing law school to be a patent attorney 

#### Only Novel Inventions can be Patented
- What is novel?
	- A person can be entitled a patent is the good is not otherwise available to the public to the extent that people interested in the subject matter, exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it before the effective filing date
	- You can make your own invention not novel and then invalidate the novelty and hence patentability of it
- Why do companies you intern or coop with ask you to sign an NDA
	- One reason is that the NDA makes it so that things you see on the job don't become something that could invalidate the patent
- You invent a new type of underwear that your partner uses for a couple years before you decide to file your patent
	- Does this count as "public use" that disqualifies your patent
		- YES, this will disqualify your patent
		- This was a real case settled by the Supreme court
- What is the effective filing date of a patent
	- Need to know 2 things
		- Provisional Patent Application
			- Placeholder that states your claim -- you have to follow up within one year
		- Continuation patents
			- Change the bounds of your invention but don't add new matter
	- Is the earliest of:
		- actual filing date
- There is a 1 year grace period where the inventor can disclose their invention and still be able to validate/patent it.
	- Only applies in the US
	- You could sell the rights to the patent without invalidating it

> [!quiz] What is the effective filing date of the patent shown on the screen? What would happen if a competitor published a description of what's in the patent before that date? What about after?
> Q1: June 3rd 2010 is the earliest date on the patent, and is thus the patent's effective filing date. If someone described the patent before this date, then the patent would be invalid (could not be awarded) as the information was public before any filing was done. If this was done afterwards than that would not invalidate the patent (would still be awarded) and the published work could be invalid as they have published material on something that has already be patented.

### Chinese Sweetener Suit
- Celanese process was used in secret in Europe before one year before the effective filing date
	- So Celanese patent was invalidated

#### An obvious idea cannot be patented
- Someone wants to patent a new process with different percentages compared to an old patent
- Obvious?
	- The new invention is a combination of A and B
	- Both A and B were previously know
	- And it was obvious to combine A and B to make the new invention
	- Obvious to a "Person having ordinary skill in the art"

### Flash of Genius
- Windshield wiper
- Basic building blocks of electronics - transistor, capacitor, variable resistor
	- Inventor just arranged the 3 in a different and new way, but did not invent the devices themselves
	- The defense argued that books are made up of words, but the words were not created by the 


> [!quiz] Was Ford trying to invalidate Kearn's patent through 35 USC 102 or 25 USC 103? Describe how A Tale of Two Cities was used to counter Ford's assertion. 
> Q2: They were trying to invalidate through 35 USC 102, claiming that the parts used were already invented and thus cannot be patented because the specific arrangement used would've been obvious to someone with experience. The lawyer countered this by bring up a novel and asking the expert witness if there was a word in that book that could not be found in a dictionary. This analogy was used to counter the assertion made by Ford by suggesting that, just because parts of a work have been defined in the past, does not mean that the arrangement of said parts is obvious.

### Sealed Crustless Sandwich
- Patent
	- The upper and lower fillings are preferably comprised of peanut butter and the center filling is comprised of at least jelly
	- Also sealed
- Smucker's applied for another patent on this technology
	- Continuation of old patent, just changing the bounds of it
	- Went to court to determine if it should be allowed
		- Smucker's sued to have that reversed
	- Went to court and then it was rejected
		- The invention was obvious 

#### How are the boundaries of the invention staked out
- Patent Claims
	- Each claim is a different set of boundaries staked for the invention
	- Each claim is one sentence
	- Can have independent claims or dependent claims
	- Dependent claims must narrow the scope of the claim it depends on
###### Example
- Over 10 claims (4 claims shown) from Lacks 2020 patent
- Why so many?
	- This prevents people from denying the claim presented in a broad claim
	- Introducing dependent claims allows the patented to argue their patent more specifically and protect against losing the patent


> [!quiz] Why do they have 7 claims, and wait until the 7th claim to mention PB&J? Why not just have one claim and this one claim specify PB&J. 
> Q3: The reason for this is to make their claim more rigid and easier to defend. Having multiple claims prevents people from denying the patent based on one claim alone, and introducing dependent claims allows the patented to argue their patent more specifically and protect against losing the patent. Waiting to specify details like PB&J until the 7th claim allows the claims to be increasingly more narrow, capturing both the process and its specifics for their products and hence increasing the strength of their first broad claim. With one claim instead of 7, it would be much easier to find weak spots in the claim and take advantage of it such that the patent is found invalid.

### A Patent must be Enabling
- Enablement
	- Must describe the invention well enough to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to make and use the patent without undue experimentation
	- Must also describe the best mode of the invention
	- But you don't need a working prototype!
#### Amgen Seeks to Monopolize Nature
- Patent system encourages sharing of ideas for the benefit of others
- Amgen's broad patents on antibodies failed to give enough information to allow a skilled person to make use of their invention


> [!quiz] Amgen's patent was invalidated by the Supreme Court because the patent did not appropriately describe something... What did it not describe?
> Q4: Amgen's broad patents on antibodies failed to give enough information to allow a skilled person to make use of their invention. Their lack of information provided allowed Amgen to have a monopoly over their invention, not just in the patent field but also in the reproducibility of their information. They lacked the enabling aspect of a patent, and should've included information to describe the invention well enough to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to make and use the patent without undue experimentation.
