### STEM Power
- Zemene arranged a big community event where students showcased their work
- Payment for teachers was $2.50 an hour, based on the local Ethiopian standards


> [!quiz] Was it ethical for Lacks to arrange payment for the teachers in the Ethiopian HS at a pay rate far below that for a teacher in the US (and far below US minimum wage). More generally, should US companies/organizations funding work in foreign countries set wages based on (a) US standards and minimum wage laws, (b) the local market rate, (c) or another approach?
> Q1: I think it was ethical, as the standard of living differs greatly between a country like the US and a country like Ethiopia. Just because the wages seem low for the US standard of living does not mean it seems low everywhere else. As Zemene found that most teachers in the area made around this rate, it seems very ethical to pay your employees with respect to this knowledge. Generally, I think you should pay foreign employees based on local wages, not the wages from your home country. Wages differ GREATLY across countries, and making people effective millionaires for doing a job that pays considerably less in their home country seems unethical and unfair.

### Big Tech & Monopolies
- Google faced antitrust cases saying that it is illegally monopolizing the market
- Facebook accused of being a monopoly because it would buy and freeze out smaller companies
- Happening to many large tech companies
- How about in cleveland, its THE place to study monopolies
	- Jeptha Wade
		- Started at a door factory but the dust caused health issues
		- Next job was a painter
		- Next job was building a telegraph line
			- Companies operated on different technologies with different standards
			- Real-life "telephone game"
			- Most companies were barely making or losing money
			- In 1857, the companies formed a 'cartel' (anticompetitive)
				- Western union was part of this (Wade, Ezra Cornell)
			- Later in the 1860s, Western Union Took it all
				- They acquired all of the big companies in the region, with the last ones being when Jeptha was president
			- The defenders of Western Unions monopoly said that the nature of telegraphs made it a natural monopoly 
				- Argued it made sense to have one system with one technology
			- Critics say that the company was cornering the market and can now charge whatever they like and limit service wherever they like


> [!quiz] What was western unions main argument for justifying a monopoly of the telegraph industry? Do you think this argument is relevant for any of the current anti-trust lawsuits?
> Q2: The defenders of Western Unions monopoly said that the nature of telegraphs made it a natural monopoly. They argued it made sense to have one system with one technology to make the system faster and more accessible. I think Google and Amazon might make this same argument, claiming that the best way to do a search engine is to use one companies technology (in googles case), and that the best way to handle shipments and deliveries is through one unified standard (in amazons case). Facebook can't really make this argument, as social media can be very diverse and doesn't need to adhere to a standard or use a specific algorithm or technology.

- Next person we'll talk about is Rockefeller
	- Had a mansion on Euclid close to Jeptha's
	- Only one mansion left in the area
	- Later moved out of the area to East Cleveland
	- Bought more and more property and owned hundreds of acres eventually
	- Guard house - Now is a Taco bell
	- Mansion -Taken down and made part of a park
	- The new park is really pretty
	- Office was buy Tower City
	- His commute was right through the middle of campus
	- What about his past
		- Born in 1839 in NY moved to Cleveland at age 4
		- Got his first job in 1855
		- Celebrated it yearly "most joyful holiday of the year"
		- Ledger A
			- Has a detailed accounting of every expenditure he made
		- Very frugal and detail oriented
		- Worked with Samuel Andrews
			- He is the one responsible for all the public art at case
- What is Kerosene? What is distillation?
	- Kerosene is a hydrocarbon used in oil lamps
	- Distillation is separating compounds in a mixture by boiling point
	- In the late 1860s, Rockefeller estimated 90% of refineries were in the red
		- Rockefeller needed more money to create economies of scale, increase efficiency, and build cash reserves
		- and needed more money to buy other refineries
		- In 1870, Standard Oil Corp was created with the goal of owning as many companies in the industry as possible
			- Clark, Payne and Company sold the refinery to Standard Oil -> Made tons of money and Payne's niece ended up being able to fund the nursing school here
		- Rockefeller told other companies that they would fail if they didn't join Standard Oil
			- Would say cryptic statements to pressure companies into selling
			- Was very persuasive
		- Ida Tarbell
			- Rockefellers most formidable rival ever
			- Determined to prove that Standard Oil had never played fair
			- Example she gave
				- He did his token negotiating style to everyone, even vulnerable widows
		- How could he afford all of this?
			- Transportation costs were the key cost driver for oil refiners
				- Crude oil from well to refinery
				- Kerosene from refinery to markets
			- He used bulk shipping deals to cut down on transportation costs
		- Was this ethical?
			- Rockefeller says it is ethical
				- Buying bulk makes sense and is a well-established practice
			- Tarbell
				- The rate was a secret, and knew that Rockefeller keeping it a secret was essential
- In 1880s, standard oil developed refineries all around the nation
	- The treasurer was Louis Severance, who then had a son who paid for severance hall
	- The Krishna statue from previously was acquired using funds from Severance
- President Harrison signed the Sherman Antitrust act to outlaw monopolies
	- Standard oil was unphased
- In 1911, the Supreme count finally said it had to break up
	- Broke up into 24ish companies including Chevron, Marathon, BP, etc.
- Rockefeller would visit Cleveland every now and then
	- Stopped due to wife's illness
	- Went to court over taxes, ruled that he doesn't need to pay anything due to NY residence
	- Rockefeller is now buried in Lakeview cemetery


> [!quiz] What was Rockefeller's argument as to why he thought it was ethical for Standard Oil to receive the railroad rebates? Is this applicable to the current anti-trust lawsuits?
> Q3: He argued that buying bulk makes sense and is ethical for large companies, saying that the army should pay less for meat than a small family. His main argument came down to buying bulk being a well-established practice for large groups and should be ethical as it is required to keep business operations running smoothly. This may be applicable to large tech companies facing anti-trust lawsuits today, as they may argue that they should receive discounts on certain necessary fees to account for their influence.

### Wines & Assessing Performance
- Wineries, many proud of how well they did at the California State Fair wine competition
- Paper set out to answer the question "But were they just lucky?"
	- Tried to answer this by putting duplicate wines in a flight for testing their reliability
	- Same exact wines with consistent experimental setup
		- Judges gave much different scores for the same wine (on the highest end to the lowest end)
	- Statistical analysis showed that no one could judge consistently
- Lacks believes this is the case with Professors and TAs grading essays
	- Tennis judging is now done entirely done by computers as people are so inconsistent


> [!quiz] Why was the wine competition discussed in the lecture? Based on the wine competition study, do you think AI grading of your work would be better than a professor or TA grading it?
> Q4: The wine competition was discussed to show how inconsistent people can be. The judgement of people is very random, and it is difficult to be consistent with anything that involves personal opinion and bias. The wine competition showed this by showing the judges with very different scores for the same wines. Moreover, they were not consistent across years. I do not think it would be better for professors to use AI instead of personal grading, at least in its current state. AI is often more inconsistent than people, and will give a different response it you are opening a new chat. I would much rather have a person be inconsistent than AI be inconsistent.
