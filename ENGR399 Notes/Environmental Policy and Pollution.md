### The Lorax
- Lake Erie line - The fish leave and say that the water is as bad as it is in Lake Erie
	- The Ohio EPA later asked to remove this line because they had improved the water quality

### Clean Water Act
- 1969 - Oil slick catches fire on the polluted Cuyahoga river in Ohio, mobilizing public concern across the nation
- Burning river pale ale discontinued, tragic
- The burning river has become a part of Cleveland identity, being a part of many businesses names in the area
- Burning River
	- Time magazine popularized the event "Almost every great city has a river, among the worst of them is the 80 mile long Cuyahoga"
	- The fire was so quick that buy the time local photographers arrived, the flames were out
	- Its more of a fable
		- The picture in the Time magazine was a picture of the 1952 fire, not the 1969 fire that they were talking about
		- This is the same thing that happens if you google "1969 Cuyahoga River Fire"
	- An incorrect image became the poster child
- So what's the real story?
	- Oil boom starts with Drake well in Western Pennsylvania
	- John D. Rockefeller, oil refining, and Cleveland
		- Chemical engineer convinces Rockefeller to team up in oil refining business and they open their first refinery in Cuyahoga
		- In 9 years, Rockefeller's Standard Oil had 21 refineries in Cleveland
			- Produced tons of pollutions
	- At least 10 total fires on the Cuyahoga river - worst was 1912 where five people were burned to death when gasoline covered surface of the river burst into flames
		- 1952 had a massive fire which produced the famous pictures which are used to misrepresent the 1969 fire
		- 1969 fire set some bridges on fire, and took 24 minutes to get it under control -> no pictures
	- The 1969 fire was not impressive or impactful, but occurred at the right time and got people thinking more about the environment
- Clean Water Act (1972)
	- Before the act
		- Private nuisance: legal activities that interfere with use, enjoyment of private land
		- Public nuisance: legal activities that interfere with a right common to the public
			- A local recent nuisance suit
				- Grandview pizza oven 
				- Couple had installed a pizza oven in the backyard
				- The smoke from the oven bothered people a couple houses down
				- No law against making pizza, but the neighbors were claiming the smoke was a nuisance
				- Pizza owners won the lawsuit
			- Another recent nuisance suit
				- Claimed that its too loud
		- Nuisance suits to protect the environment didn't work out so well
			- Private Nuisance issues
				- You have to claim that the harm you suffer is different that the harm suffered by the public generally
				- Must show the harm caused by the particular polluter... difficult of pollution is coming from different sources
			- Public Nuisance issues
				- Facilities with state permit for discharge can't be sued for public nuisance for that discharge
	- After the act
		- Now there is a criminal law against discharging pollutants, not just nuisance suits
		- You have to get a permit now to discharge, but you will be monitored by the EPA as you need to report what you are doing and record samples to report back to the EPA
		- Permits specify what and how much you can discharge into the environment
	- Marathon Refinery in Ohio
		- Permit: lists maximum concentrations, average concentrations, what chemicals, etc.
			- Facility must self-monitor and report back to the EPA
			- If no discharge limit is listed, you still have to monitor and report
			- Penalties if you do not comply


> [!quiz] A) What was the legal means of fighting water pollution before 1972, and what was a problem with this approach? B) The clean water act does not strictly prohibit any discharge of pollutants into rivers and streams. What is the mechanism by which the Clean Water act ensures these waters remain clean?
> Q1: A) Before the Clean Water Act you had to go with nuisance suits against the companies. This was a problem as it was difficult to file private nuisance suits due to the specificity (declaring where pollutants came from exactly and measured impact), and public nuisance suits didn't work in some places due to governmental protections.
> B) To discharge anything, you need to have a permit. You are still allowed to discharge, but you need to report, record, and send in all of the chemicals to the EPA. You cannot do this without a permit, and you need to keep careful tabs on average discharge amounts and where they are going. You risk losing the business if found in non-compliance, keeping the environment clean.

- Mayor Stokes began Cuyahoga cleanup even before the fire
	- Faced many more serious crises than air and water pollution like clothing, housing, etc.
		- Wondered if the emphasis on the environmental issues would push these more serious issues to the side
	- Today, the Cuyahoga river is clean!
		- But what about the other more important issues like housing clothing racism etc.
		- "We have finite resources to solve problems like housing, inequality, institutional racism, environmental degradation, and so on. The question then is how to prioritize different competing causes -- that is:  how should we allocate our finite resources, given that funding one cause necessarily means fewer resources to support other causes?"
			- For example: image you are a political figure in Cleveland who can either fund a pre-school for young people which will have a ripple effect through generations, or you can fund a climate mitigation plan. If you had to chose between these two, how would you weigh these against each other?


> [!quiz] What was the gist of Mayor Stokes concern of the environmental crisis overshadowing other crises, and what is your opinion on this matter?
> Q2: Mayor Stokes was worries that, because we have finite resources to deal with problems, that taking the environmental crisis head on would not only overshadow other crises, but also pull resources away from them and make it much more difficult to put any concern toward them. My thoughts on this is that there should be moderation. It is clear that environmental concerns should be addressed, but I believe it to be equally as important to give members of the community a more immediate boost in quality of life. Environmental fixes have long term outlook for the betterment of society, but that means nothing if the current members of society cannot lead happy, safe, and clean lives. This is similar to a parent who spends all their time at work and not with their family. Sure, they will have money in the future to support their family and children's long term goals, but that won't matter if their family leaves because they didn't spend enough time with them. Ultimately, if you put resources towards environmental causes, it should be a percentage of them, carefully weighed against the current state of the population. 

### Lakeside Place in Mentor Ohio
- Movie clip
	- Key Chemical: Hexavalent Chromium
	- Events took place near compressor station in Hinkley
	- Chromium added to cooling water to prevent rusting in cooling towers
- Chromium
	- Cr+6: Highly toxic but also very useful
	- Cr+3: Used in supplements - very safe but not as useful
- Back to Mentor Ohio Lakeside
	- Used to look like an industrial/chemical plant (diamond shamrock)
	- Produced chromium
	- Plant is just sat there now after shutting down in '76'
- Superfund Law
	- Gives the federal government to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health of safety
	- Who is liable?
		- Retroactive: You are liable even if waste was put there before the law was enacted
		- Joint and Several: You might have to pay for full cleanup even if others also caused damage
		- Strict: You are liable even if actions were accepted as industry standards when you first operated the machinery/plant
		- Current owners are liable if even they had nothing to do with the waste and didn't even know it was there
	- What happened to the Diamond Shamrock Site
		- Was a superfund site
		- Completed closure of the area in 1982...
			- Included installing sheet piling to prevent further pollution


> [!quiz] A) What specifically does the superfund law authorize in regard to hazardous substances? B)  Why might people not like the Joint and Several Clause? What reason was given in lecture?
> Q3: A) The superfund law gives the federal government to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health of safety.
> B) People might be upset with the Joint and Several Liability Clause as they might have to pay for full cleanup even if others also caused damage. If 3 companies cause the problem, two large groups and one very small group. If the two large companies back out of the agreement but the small group stays and the superfund clause comes in, then the small group is then held fully responsible, even though they did the least damage. They would be mostly upset as they can be held FULLY responsible for something they only played a small part in.

- Superfund law only covers shutting it down, but volunteers are needed to remove it
- Voluntary action program
	- When cleanup requirements are met, the EPA issues a covenant not to sue
- Hemisphere, a company who specializes turning environmental disasters into business opportunities
	- Cleaned up the Mentor site to make a combination of commercial, recreation, and other structures
	- After remediation, the land became acceptably safe. 
		- Big difference than the severe risk reported for the area earlier
- Public Forum
	- People concerned about living on a contaminated waste dump
		- EPA responds by claiming it will be safe
	- In 2022, someone asks why there was not action taken to remove it instead just to cover it
		- EPA said it was much less than what required excavation and that the chemical would naturally degrade over time
- Is it ethical to build homes at the Bluffs despite the satisfaction of the EPA?


> [!quiz] What is the issue in regard to building homes at Lakeview Bluffs, and what is the role that you think science and the EPA should play in this regard?
> Q4: The plant used to be a toxic waste dump due to its production of Hexavalent Chromium. The issue of building homes on this is that the toxic soil was just pushed under yards of fresh soil. People are concerned that it will still contaminate the area because it was not excavated, and thus would impact any homes on the soil. I think science is a good guide here, and that if the reports say that it is safe to live there then it is most likely safe to live there. But, as we discussed in class, science is ever evolving and is self-correcting. I believe it is ethical for the EPA and science to allow homes to be built here, as it seems safe beyond a reasonable doubt. But I can see people being skeptical of this because they are still living on toxic chemicals, even if it will naturally degrade over time. I, and I assume many others, would not chose this place to live due to the risk of long term changes in sciences assessment of Hexavalent Chromium's risk.
