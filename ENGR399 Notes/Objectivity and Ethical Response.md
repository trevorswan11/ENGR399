1. Do Engineers act objectively and distanced from personal belief and policies
2. Is government response to community outcry always ethical
3. Ethical balancing of safety, environment, and property rights
4. Ethics of projects with disproportionate impacts on certain groups 
### MLK - Lacks
- Dec 1, 1955 - Rosa Parks arrested for not giving up her seat on bus
- 3pm Dec 5, 1955 - MLK elected president of the Montgomery improvement association
- 7pm Dec 7, 1955 - MLK gives first major speech â†’ Montgomery bus boycott
- 1965 - MLK leads the Selma to Montgomery March
#### What's the lesson learned from MLK Story?

> [!quiz] Quiz
> Highways and other engineering decisions have benefits for some and negative consequences for others. The highway department built the highway in not 'improved' places. The power and status held by certain communities affects their ability to influence the decisions made that will impact their community. Shaker Heights was able to prevent the highway, while Alabama could not.

Engineers claimed that interstate locations were decided based on the distribution of the urban and rural population, motor vehicle ownership, and irrespective of bias.

### Objectivity - Emilie & Lacks

> [!question] Objectivity... Is it Possible?
> Do you think, in general, that engineers act objectively - that they are able to separate their personal beliefs and political persuasions from the decisions they make as engineers? To what  extent do you think its possible for engineers - or anyone - to be truly "objective" or free of any bias whatsoever?

- Some fields it may not be possible, but others it may be.
- Depends on the engineer
- Some issues it is impossible, some it does not matter
- Any situation that requires one to use their judgement, makes it impossible to ignore your own biases
	- Can never truly neutralize biases, but instead you should be explicit about your biases and should try to make them 'good'

#### Now lets look into Ohio, moving away from Alabama
How I-290 was picked...
- Was planned to go through Shaker Heights
- Why? If we don't then there will be so much traffic it will be impossible to navigate Fairmount
- The I-290 route looks quite, no cars, no freeway today
- Protests against the planned freeway in shaker heights in 1964
	- Ultimately declared dead and was never built


> [!question] Government Response
> Is it always beneficial for the government to be responsive to community outcry
> 
> What if some communities have more power, privilege, and influence than other communities, and they use this advantage to shape government policies in ways that benefit them but harm others?
> 
> How might this potential problem be resolved?

- The community in Alabama was not effluent or powerful enough to prevent the highway from being built
- The community here had more influence, and could prevent having to relocate due to a highway being placed through their community
- Some people still want the highway, but just somewhere else. Who's to say that this new place is not going to faced by a similar argument? When do you draw the line and just start or stop the project?

##### Opportunity Corridor
- Part of the I-290 project/path
- NE Ohio elected leaders argue benefit for neighborhoods are less clear
	- Speeding is encouraged due to how it is built
	- Depresses home values
	- QoL will most likely decrease for residents
- Poor and middle class people $\to$ opportunity for who?
	- Not much they can do about it anyway

> [!quiz] Why opposed to corridor?
> 76 million families and 16 businesses displaced. Road width encourages encourages speeding. Pollution Problems due to high traffic. The neighborhood affected has lower class citizens who cannot really make use of the road due to not being able to afford cars, relying on public transit.


> [!question] Precedent
> Consider a particular project, such as building a highway through a city. Should the history of how past (unrelated) highway projects have affected certain groups of people be taken into consideration? Should the racial or ethnic identity of the communities most affected influence the decision of engineers.
#### Strongsville Freeway - New Interchange
- Interchanges are too crowded going down from the airport to Columbus
- Boston Road wants an interchange to reduce congestion, but homes around their will be disrupted not only due to new infrastructure, but also due to the enter/exit being crowded with cars experiencing traffic during certain hours. 
	- DoT tracks accidents, and it is clear that the crashes are very localized along the two interchanges 
		- would be argued that, for the overall betterment of society, then another interchange should be made to improve safety
	- People did die
- Protests as people don't want to lose their homes. Don't they have a right to their homes?
	- Property value decreased a lot 


> [!question] Displacement and Safety
> How do you balance traffic safey and the displacement of peple from their homes? Can you quantify this in terms of crashes or fatalities vs. number of people displaced.
> 
> How might your answer change if you happend to live in one of the homes that will be demolished to build the highway? Do you think that people have a right not to be displaced, even if being displaced would save more lives?
> 
> Or: imagine that 1000 people would have to be displaced to statistically save 10 people. Is this justifies? Now imagine 100 people need to be displaced to save 1000 people. 1000000? Where do you draw the line> Where is the morally relevant threshold beyond which utilitarian calculations become clearly warranted? 

- You can make roads safer without displacing people
	- There are alternative ways of preventing crashes
	- Make people better drivers
	- Reduced Lane width
- Would adding another interchange just get crowded over time?
	- More lanes = more opportunity to crash
	- More drivers = more people to not pay attention to
	- Long term goals may backfire, even if short term goals are met


#### Bratislava - European Case Study
- Highway built right through beautiful area
- Want to make a park over a old part of town
-
