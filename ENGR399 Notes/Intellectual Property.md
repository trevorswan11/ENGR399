### Three Key Parts
1. Trademark
2. Copyright
3. Patent

#### Trademarks
- Any word name or symbol used to identify or distinguish goods
- Judicial system is what applies these laws, the laws themselves are very sparse, and the judicial systems interpret them
- Lacks in Myanmar
	- Someone in Myanmar could create a store named Walmart with the same name and logo
	- Myanmar didn't have international IP laws
- There are no IP police, if you see someone in violation of your trademark, you must be the one to bring it to court to dispute it
- Tinder
	- Wants to shut down 3nder, as tinder claimed that it violated their trademark
- Apple
	- Wanted to trademark the term 'App Store' - Microsoft disputed it and apple couldn't get the trademark
- Taco Tuesday
	- Was trademarked by 'Taco Johns' - so no one else could use it
	- Taco Bell filed a petition to cancel the trademark, so now it can be used for all who sell tacos
- Velcro
	- Velcro Brand - associated with the hook and loop technology
	- Trademarks go away after people use trademarked names for things that actually aren't owned or produced by the actual company
	- A trademark shall be determined abandoned if conduct of the owner including acts of omission cause the mark to become a generic name for the good or service.
- Granola, Yo-Yo, Escalator, Pilates
	- All used to be brand names, but became so wide spread so it became the generic name and the trademarks for these products were lost
- Ultimate 'Frisbee'
	- Frisbee is a brand name, so calling it Ultimate Frisbee reduced their trademark
- Teflon
	- Lacks used the word Teflon in an article, but he didn't include the trademark symbol
	- Received an email telling him to change it
- Purell
	- White house says that they are using a lot of Purell, but in the briefing they used generic hand sanitizer in place of the name 'Purell'


> [!quiz] Lacks discussed his personal interactions with companies where engineers expressed concern in regards to their companies trademark. Describe the concern that was expressed.
> Q1: Professor Lacks referred to PTFE as Teflon in his article without using the trademark symbol, calling the chemical by a 'generic', but trademarked, name. The engineers were concerned about his lack of clarification of the trademark of the name, as they did not want to lose the Patent that Dupont has on PTFE as Teflon. 

#### Copyright
- Protects original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression
- Covers the expression of such ideas, not the ideas themselves
- Fair Use
	- Fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement
	- Four Criteria for fair use
		1. Purpose and character of the use, whether it is transformational, educational, or for non-profit purposes
		2. The nature of the copyrighted work - is the copyrighted work extraordinarily creative?
		3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
		4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
- NBA 2k
	- Tattoo artist of Lebron had a Tattoo of theirs, so they sued
	- The tattoo artist owns a place in Coventry (Cleveland Heights)
- Computer Programs
	- A computer program, whether in object code or source code, is a literary work and thus copyright laws are irrelevant
	- Fair use
- Generative AI
	- Gets trained on a lot of data, so OpenAI ends up using a lot of copyrighted data
	- Is it legal? (is the data used fair use)
		- The decision will come from interpretation of US judges, but there is nothing on it yet
	- Non-generative AI
		- Copyrighted search prompts were used to develop the material
		- Criteria
			- Goes against the first factor of the criteria
			- Search prompts are minimally creative
			- Factor 3 in favor, as the copied search prompts were never made public
			- The AI product would compete directly with the product it from which it got the data
		- Determined was infringement


> [!quiz] What is fair use? Choose one factor used in assessing fair use and explain how, in terms of this factor, generative AI's use of copyrighted materials as data for training the AI would favor or oppose a determination of fair use.
> Q2: Fair use means that a copyrighted use is able to be used without infringement of copyright law, fitting 4 pre-established criteria. The most glaring violation of Generative AI is the violation of the 4th criteria, where the AI is taking away the market value of the copyrighted work. Since the AI has a summary of any answers that people may be looking for, they will be going to the AI for answers presented in various copyrighted works throughout its dataset. With more and more people going to these AI programs to generate responses that they would've otherwise had to look for in copyrighted work, the original work loses value and the AI gains market value. This important distinction violated the 4th factor, and acts in opposition for fair use.

##### Generative AI Ethics
- Is it moral for generative AI companies to use materials to use materials from writers and artists as training data without their explicit permission?
	- Academic Publishers
		- Two companies signed deals with AI Companies
		- Artists work becomes part of the AI's output, so the original artists work loses value and thus the artist loses value themselves
		- Can be put out of a job
	- Emile's Book "Human Extinction"
		- He gets 2.5% of the sales, after years and years of work
		- The publisher gets most of the benefits
		- The publisher later signed a deal with Microsoft, so the book can now be used for training models
		- "Copyright in the work will remain with the author, who licenses the Publisher to make a copy available in any format worldwide on a non-exclusive basis. This permits the Publisher to distribute the Work in any format at any time"
			- Artists and writers boycotted the company, not because of the legality (was mostly legal due to contract/licensing agreement signed), but because of the ethics of the decision to sign the deal
		- Value neutrality thesis
			- These systems require training on other peoples data
			- They need data from the 'little guy' to produce a new product which then benefits the people owning the company
			- Is there a certain value or politics built into these large language models?


> [!quiz] Do you think generative AI can be considered to "have politics"? Explain.
> Q3: Yes, I think the only way that AI can work is by taking from people smaller than it. There is no realistic way for AI to function without taking from people in society, and it is unrealistic for a group of developers or some other team to create the shear amount of content (sometimes slop) required to make a proper useful AI tool. Because of this necessity, AI is not value neutral. It imposes values of stealing from the small to help the large, where small and large represent influence and strength on society. To get roughly even depictions of societal views, AI must survey everyone's work and steal from everyone who is creative or not. This stealing benefits powerful people and thus AI ultimately has its own inherent politics/values.

#### Patents
- Windshield Wipers
	- Creator is Case Alum
	- Ford stole it, but he sued Ford and one!
- What rights?
	- Right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout the US
- Why get a patent?
	- Deter others from stealing ideas
	- Deter others from entering market
	- Attract investment
	- License of sell parent others
- Why NOT get a patent?
	- Gets a lot of money (10-40k)
	- NO patent police, so you have to dedicate your own resources to bust people in violation
	- Might be better to keep the idea a secret
- An important caveat
	- Not set in stone, could be ruled invalid if brought to court correctly
		- Apple's swipe-to-unlock patent
			- Apple sued Samsung for infringement and won
			- Samsung appealed and the verdict was overturned and then Apple's patent was ruled to be invalid due to it being obvious
- Who can "have" a patent to an invention
	- Whoever invents of discovers any new and useful process
	- Only the inventor can "obtain" a patent
	- Anyone can own a patent, but is a contractual agreement between the inventor and the owner
- Many people might work on a project... Who are the "inventors"?
	- Do people really care?
		- Moderna Covid vaccine
	- You have to put the actual inventors, or else it could be ruled invalid
- Lacks' patent
	- Is an inventor, but signed it over to the Assignee
	- GOJO was assigned the patent through a consulting agreement
		- Lacks gets paid for being the consultant
- What if you use AI for the invention
	- If AI is a main piece, it would not be granted a patent
- What can be patented
	- Any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of nature
	- Excludes
		- Ideas, concepts


> [!Quiz] You are an engineer at a company which produces PE in the US and Mexico. A competitor produces PE with a better catalyst whose process is patented in the US. How can you - legally and without a license -  make the PE with a better catalyst and sell PE in the US.
> Q4: Here, the key idea is that we can't use the catalyst in the US without licensing, but we can use the catalyst in Mexico. If we use the catalyst to make the PE in Mexico, we can sell the PE in the US because the process to make the PE was not patented. So the use of the catalyst was in Mexico, where the catalyst is not patented. Since the process after the catalyst is used is not patented, we can just bring the PE into the US because the catalyst patent is not seen at all. The catalyst ITSELF is patented, but not the catalyst being used to make PE. 

###### Virtue Ethics & Patents
- A lot of us feel that there is something wrong with taking the data from people to make AI
- For vaccines though, a lot of us feel that the vaccines shouldn't have a patent so other developing countries can be able to make these vaccines freely


> [!quiz] Apply a virtue ethics approach to analyze the ethics of upholding patent rights for a vaccine during a pandemic.
> Q5: To seek the betterment of society and overall happiness with the best outcome, the patent rights should be dropped during a pandemic. This will allow people to have make use of the vaccine freely and out of the jurisdiction of the original patent, which will ultimately do the most good and result in the most people being happy about the situation everywhere. The companies may suffer and lose money, but still the people and society will be better as a whole.
