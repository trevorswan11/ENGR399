# The Trolly Problem
## Consequentialism
> [!definition] 
> The morally right action is that which leads to the best consequences.

- **Utilitarianism**: the most influential version of consequentialism
	- Mill
- **Deontology**: Morally right actions follow duties and/or respect rights of others...  regardless of the consequences (to some degree or another)
	- The categorical importance: do not use other people solely as a means to an end
	- Kent
- **Virtue Ethics**: Oldest of the three. In Christianity, "What would Jesus do?"
	- Being virtuous is the only way to achieve happiness, and happiness should be the end goal
	- Happiness is the ultimate end
	- Aristotle

## Ethical Questions
1. Factual
	- Are there facts that would influence our answer
2. Conceptual
	- Do any key ideas have ambiguous definitions
3. Moral
	- What are the distinctly moral issues

#### Is it ethical to require vaccines?
- **Factual**: Health risks of vaccination...  need real and accurate scientific evidence
- **Conceptual**: What is an acceptable risk? What is safe?
- **Moral**: Personal freedom, liberty. Your vaccine affects the health of others in the community

##### Moral Issues
- One might argue that vaccine mandates are a violation of personal freedoms
- Alternatively:
	- Imagine vaccination reduces contagiousness
	- Might be hospitalized, taking up space in hospitals
	- Affects the health of the community as a whole

This is where thinking about consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics can be helpful:
- Maybe vaccine mandates are for the "greater good" (utilitarianism) - or maybe not
- Maybe deontological moral rules about never harming others make it wrong to not get vaccinated? Or would deontological values make it wrong to require vaccinations?

> [!example] Tracking down assassin in neighborhood
> Can't trust all sources, and sometimes you have to go all the way back to the original source to test more modern sources credibility.

> Sources reported Warrensville, but actually in Orange County!

> [!example] The history of Electricity
> Cat fur, feathers, wool discussed in textbooks about the discovery of electrostatics, but that's not the case and Lacks wrote a paper about it!

Moral of the story? You can't really trust what you read at face value. Be critical and check the information presented against the reference presented at the end of the paper!
- You need to look at the factual, conceptual, and moral aspects of the story being told in order to properly judge and analyze a story
- *To get the factual part correct, you must be very critical of your sources, and should focus on primary sources the most!*

### Do Artifacts have Politics?
Consider what philosophers of tech call the "value neutrality thesis" which says that technologies are inherently neutral - they are mere things that don't care how they're used

If these technologies are used for malicious purposes, we should blame the user rather than the tech itself
#### The value-neutrality thesis
Consider the case of nuclear weapons. One might argue that we shouldn't oppose nuclear proliferation as "Nuclear weapons don't destroy counties, countries destroy countries."

> [!example] Example: Guns
> Guns *could* be used to do anything, but they were designed for a certain way. In this sense, the particular design of guns inclines users to use this technology for specific purposes.

Philosophers overwhelmingly reject value neutrality, but who knows they might be wrong!
