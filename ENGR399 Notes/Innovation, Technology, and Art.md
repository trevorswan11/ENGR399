Technical innovations played a key role in the defeat of the Nazis
- Radar was perhaps the most important invention that allowed the allies to win
	- And it led to peacetime innovations that are now a big part of our lives
- Naval mines were also influential but are less known
	- Early mines float right under the surface and donated on contact
	- They were found out and easily detected/destroyed
	- Advanced mines were thus created
		- Sensed the ship coming and detonated without contact
			- First iteration used magnetic sensing that the mine would detect, but navies found that producing electric fields would cancel out the magnet
		- Required US Navy Engineers to push through the cutting edge of electronics
			- Joseph Keithley developed and studied the creation of such solution
			- After the war, found that it would be useful for peacetime operations
			- Keithley Multimeters were thus created and are now seen in labs across the globe
- How does this relate to the Picasso painting?
	- It was donated by the Keithley family!

### Cambodian Art - Technology and Ethics
- Sonya Rhie Mace - Cleveland Museum of Art Curator
- Krishna Statue from HW8 - Q10
	- Came from southern Cambodia
		- Most museum curators don't know the origins of their displays, just the dealer or collector they got it from
		- The CMA knows exactly where the Krishna statue came from
	- CMA had some feet of Krishna, but the rest of the statue was in Cambodia
	- The Cleveland Krishna (a different statue) was from another cave in Cambodia
	- CMA used LIDAR and blender to determine which parts belonged to Cambodia's statue and which belonged to Cleveland's
	- Used Unity and HoloLens to simulate the cave
	- The statue fell out of worship when the Hindu community was defeated, and the attackers knocked over the statue to dig out the gold and gems that were left as offerings under the statue
		- Vietnamese peoples later found the statue, and started cutting the statue to turn it into the Buddha
		- A French sailor then traded it, who then traded it for a motorbike, then it ended up on display but the buyers didn't know what it was and instead thought it was Krishna dancing
	- After many years, it was on display in the Cambodia National Museum
		- Had the wrong pieces that matched Cleveland
		- Wrong pieces were also in Cleveland but matched Cambodia
		- The two museum collaborated and exchanged correct pieces
			- This created what we have in Cleveland
- Another statue/work in the CMA
	- Was stolen from the West Wall of Banteay Chhmar
		- Was looted in 1999 by Cambodian army personnel
			- Seized on route by the Thai Police
			- Was then put in the Cambodian Museum
			- CMA then purchased it
			- Later, CMA returned it
	- They later rebuilt the wall and the temple it was a part of
		- Children were taught about its importance
		- Still one section of the wall that is in someone's garden in Thailand
- Bottom line
	- There was no sense that art should just be art
	- Not everything needs to be in a museum
		- Art can be art just for arts sake
		- Just because something looks beautiful doesn't mean it deserves to be removed from its original context 


> [!quiz] What were the key ethical and technological issues involving the Ten-armed Lokeshvara
> Q1: The key ethical issues were the acquisition of the art. It was originally looted in 1999 by Cambodian army personnel from a temple, then seized on route by the Thai Police, and then put in the Cambodian Museum. The CMA then bought the piece from Cambodia, but this wasn't necessarily ethical as it originated from a worship site from which it was wrongfully taken. The key technological issue was the process of rebuilding the wall after the CMA returned the pieces. The pieces had to be carefully lined up and laid down, like a massive complex jigsaw puzzle. To achieve the restoration, they had to also remove some parts from the remaining wall.

### Michael Goldberg - Fulbright Award
- Went to Cambodia
- Entrepreneurship drives museums through young peoples creativity in the promotion scope

> [!quiz] Briefly describe Professor Goldberg's idea of how entrepreneurship can be integrated with the repatriation of art to Cambodia
> Q2: Funneling into creative ideas of young people to think differently in their ideas of entrepreneurship. His idea focuses on harnessing creativity and new platforms in order to encourage more and more people to come to view the art. Entrepreneurship can be integrated by using new platforms, like social media, to encourage larger demographics of people to see what you have on display.

### Art and AI at Case Western
- Hinczewski - Physics Professor
- Large project
	- Optics team
	- Comp Sci team
	- Art history team
	- CIA
	- CMA
	- Student painters
- Collaboration with Factum Arte, Madrid, Spain
	- Foremost organization at the intersection of art and tech
	- Access to spectacular artwork
	- Toolbox of bespoke 3D recording technology
- Does surface topography provide brushstroke "fingerprints" of an artists style?
- Can we develop AI methods to distinguish among members of workshop contributing to a single painting
- First step - controlled experiment
	- 9 painting students
	- 3 identical paining each
	- Topographical maps
	- Use AI and ML to determine which strokes in patches of the 4 paintings belonged to who
	- Accuracy is great until patch size exceeds 20mm, then it starts to degrade quickly to around 60% accuracy just past 40mm
- Was applied to a Vox episode "Why I am obsessed with these cheap paintings of Paris"
- How can we apply these ideas to historical paintings
	- Pairwise Assignment Training for Classifying Heterogeneity (PATCH)
		- Workshop Painting
			- Believed: Many people came together
			- ML: Had a lot of uniformity suggesting someone came along after and patched up errors 
		- Christ on Cross
			- Shown was likely created by 1 person
		- Students drawings
			- Compiled into one map
			- Model found 4 different artists


> [!quiz] Describe in one sentence how AI was used to determine if more than one artist contributed to the painting. (be sure to mention the characteristic of the painting that AI uses)
> Q3: AI is used by initially telling the model that a painting was made by multiple people, and then it goes through a topographical map looking for characteristics that influence the height of certain regions due to different people or environment, indicating creation by a single artist if the model fails.
